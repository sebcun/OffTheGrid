# OffTheGrid

Offthegrid is a basic 3d vector game built using ThreeJS where you aim is to well live of the grid, building farms, getting energy to power your farms, and gain materials.
It is pretty simple, I wanted to add more features but unfortunately ran out of time as something important popped up mid week.
